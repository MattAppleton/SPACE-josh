Riley’s powers of persuasion and Moore’s commitment to supporting younger artists are clear. This letter demonstrates  
a determination to expand SPACE to other sites: ‘There are also  six other affiliated warehouses scattered around London under the umbrella of “Space” which provide for another 170 artists. Yet we still have a waiting list of 250 names and so will be expanding’. Moore finally visited St Katharine Docks late in 1970, garnering further publicity for the SPACE cause.
The essays in this book are grouped into three sections.  
We are fortunate to have new texts by Bridget Riley and Peter Sedgley, describing why and how they set up SPACE. These are followed by some art historical context. Andrew Wilson focuses  on the Arts Lab movement and the Antiuniversity as contempora-neous self-organising structures, and Courtney J Martin considers the work of SPACE artist Rasheed Araeen and the impact that 
his experience at St Katharine Docks had on his work.
Naomi Pearce describes the Art Information Registry (AIR),  the sister organisation to SPACE, through the eyes of Letty Mooring, its first ‘official’ administrator. Robert Kudielka’s text was originally published to coincide with the SPACE exhibition London Now in Berlin at the Akademie der Künste, Berlin, 1971. It explains the London art scene and SPACE to an international audience in a text that feels as vibrant and urgent now as it would have done then.
In section two William Fowler explores experimental practice at 10 Martello Street, a studio site which fascinates due to a grouping of artists working between performance, music, installation and film. Ana Torok examines the birth of the Artists Union, conceived in the early ’70s by artists based at SPACE, considering its recent reincarnation and relevance today. Alicia Miller examines chal-lenges faced by AIR and SPACE as the organisation experienced growing pains.
