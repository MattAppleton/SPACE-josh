The birth of SPACE in 1968 coincided with student protests and autonomous interventions in cities across Europe. Asserting rights to space was a theme common to student sit-ins, squatting and free festivals. The unique contribution made to the city by SPACE is that its founders, Bridget Riley and Peter Sedgley, negoti-ated vast amounts of space for creativity through legitimate means, and many have subsequently benefited from the example they set. Setting up a company, Riley and Sedgley persuaded authorities and landlords to lease them property to which artists could bring new life and creative uses. SPACE proved that artists could be trusted and were adept at taking on and managing risks. They envisaged and realised new uses for buildings at a post-war moment when new ways of thinking were much needed.
