With nearly 800 artist tenants in SPACE studios today, illus-trating the value of SPACE for art in London over 50 years cannot ever adequatlely describe how artists have benefitted. We have attempted to provide a list of SPACE artist tenants, which amounts to around 3,000, but this is bound to be incomplete. More books could be written about AIR Gallery, SPACEâ€™s current gallery and programme at Mare Street, The White Building, or its learning programme with schools and local communities.
