Images are as important to the story as texts, however cameras and photographic processing were prohibitively expensive for many artists in the early days of SPACE. Luckily a few photographers were around. As a student at Guildford School of Art, Andrew Tweedie photographed St Katharine Docks, as did Douglas Smith who was commissioned by SPACE. Shirley Read, SPACE studios manager from 1972 to 1975, photographed all the studio buildings for SPACEâ€™s London-wide Open Studios event in 1975.
