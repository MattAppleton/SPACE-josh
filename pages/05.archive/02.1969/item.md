On 6 July 1969 Riley wrote to Moore saying that they were 
‘delighted that the Erasmus Foundation had been in touch and had agreed to give half of Moore’s prize money to SPACE’.  
The letter ended with a gentle but persistent reminder: ‘We are still hoping that you will find time to visit St Katharine’s Dock [sic]’. An entry in Moore’s diary for 22 July 1969 reads ‘6pm Douglas Smith (SPACE film)’, referring to Moore’s appearance in a film commissioned by SPACE.
