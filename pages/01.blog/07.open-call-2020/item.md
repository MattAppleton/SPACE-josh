SPACE invites proposals for projects to be made in dialogue with older people based in Ilford.

===

The commission will include activity with which older people can engage, either in person or remotely, that will inform a commissioned solo exhibition as part of SPACE’s exhibition programme. This community-focused project is suitable for an artist with experience developing participatory and socially engaged art projects with older people. We are looking for a project which will attract a wide range of visitors. This project is the second year of a three-year programme supported by Mercers’ Charitable Foundation.

Application deadline: Sunday 3 May 2020, midnight
