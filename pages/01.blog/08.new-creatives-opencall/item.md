This newly launched initiative provides the opportunity for young people, based in London, to produce new work with the support of industry professionals. SPACE is one of six production partners including the ICA, Kingston School of Art, NTS, Chisenhale Gallery, Dazed Media and Werkflow. Successful applicants are invited to present their work in a dedicated showcase at the ICA and their work may also be selected to be broadcast on television and radio under BBC Introducing Arts, made available on BBC iPlayer or BBC Sounds.
